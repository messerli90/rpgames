# RPGames

A project to help bring excitement back into older games by crowd-sourcing fun ideas for run-throughs and challenges.

## Quick Start

- run `git clone git@github.com:messerli90/rpgames.git`
- copy `.env.example` to `.env`; this should stay up to date with testing credentials
- run `composer install` to pull in PHP dependencies
- run `art migrate --seed` to set up DB and import required resources as well as testing resources
- run `npm install` to pull in JS dependencies
- run `gulp` to compile JS & CSS
